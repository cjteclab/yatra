# Yatra ðŸ¦‹ - My Journey into the World of Embedded Linux, Security, and Open Source

Welcome to Yatra â€“ the journey of exploration, growth, and mastery in the world of Linux, Embedded Systems, and IT Security! Here, Iâ€™ll document my progress, challenges, and discoveries as I dive deeper into the realms of open source technology and embedded computing. My GitHub handle is cj from CJTechLab, and you can also find me as papi11on â€“ inspired by the French word papillon, symbolizing transformation and freedom.
What is Yatra?

In Sanskrit, Yatra means journey, and this project is exactly that: a logbook of my learning journey and an evolving portfolio of projects, scripts, and tools. Iâ€™m on a path to deepen my understanding, share my experiences, and connect with like-minded individuals around the world who share my passion for open-source and free software. Through this journey, I aim to go beyond mere knowledge â€“ to achieve the skills and insights that define true expertise.
Themes and Goals

## In Yatra, I explore:

- Linux and Embedded Systems: From system administration to creating custom Linux distributions, my focus is on understanding and working with Linux at a deep level, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
- IT Security: I aim to develop practical skills in security fundamentals, including secure coding, encryption, and ethical hacking, to become an expert in building and defending secure systems.
- Programming Languages: My journey includes learning and mastering C, Python, and Bash scripting â€“ the essential languages for system programming and automation.
- Microcontrollers and Bare Metal Programming: Iâ€™m passionate about getting hands-on with hardware, exploring how to optimize and control embedded devices.

## Long-Term Goals

- Build Real-World Skills: Document and share projects that reflect practical applications of embedded Linux, systems security, and software development.
- Become an Open Source Contributor: Contribute meaningfully to open source communities, sharing knowledge, tools, and solutions.
- Connect and Collaborate: Engage with others on a similar path and learn from experts in the field, always open to discussions and collaborations.

## Letâ€™s Connect!
