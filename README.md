# **Yatra ðŸ¦‹ - My Journey into the World of Linux and Embedded Systems**

Welcome to **Yatra** â€“ my journey of exploration, growth, and mastery in the realms of Linux, Embedded Systems, Microcontroller and IT Security! This repository is my logbook, compendium, and portfolio as I progress toward becoming a virtuoso in these fields.  
I am **cj** from **cjteclab**, and you may also know me as **papillon**.

## **What is Yatra?**
In Sanskrit, *Yatra* means "journey," and this project is exactly that: an ongoing record of my learning, experimentation, and achievements. My goal is to go beyond acquiring knowledge to mastering the skills and insights that define true expertise.

Through this repository, I aim to:  
- **Document My Journey**: Capture daily/weekly learning, reflections, and discoveries.  
- **Share Knowledge**: Build a compendium of articles, tutorials, and tools.  
- **Demonstrate Progress**: Showcase practical projects and code, reflecting real-world applications.  
- **Inspire Collaboration**: Connect with like-minded enthusiasts and professionals who share my passion for technology.
